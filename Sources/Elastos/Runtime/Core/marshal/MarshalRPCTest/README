This sample is too primitive, and it should be replaced with the better one.
Don't care about its coding style and quality, it will be redesigned and recoded.

Before building it, please:
1. modify '../CMakeLists.txt'

2. modify
" #define ELASTOS_SMANS_IP "127.0.0.1" // It's your SMan IP. "
in ./SManC/CSManC.cpp
