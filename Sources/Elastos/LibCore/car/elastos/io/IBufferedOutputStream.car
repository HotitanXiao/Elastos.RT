    * Wraps an existing OutputStream and buffers the output. Expensive interaction with
    * the underlying input stream is minimized, since most (smaller) requests can be
    * satisfied by accessing the buffer alone. The drawback is that some extra space is
    * required to hold the buffer and that copying takes place when flushing that
    * buffer, but this is usually outweighed by the performance benefits.
    * <p>
    * A typical application pattern for the class looks like this:
    * <p>
    * BufferedOutputStream buf = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("file.java"));
    * @sa BufferedInputStream
    *@implement Elastos.IO.IFilterOutputStream
