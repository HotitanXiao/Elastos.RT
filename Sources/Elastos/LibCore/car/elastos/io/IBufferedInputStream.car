    * required to hold the buffer and that copying takes place when filling that
    * buffer, but this is usually outweighed by the performance benefits.

    * A typical application pattern for the class looks like this:
    * BufferedInputStream buf = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.java"));
