     * The order rule must be both transitive (if {@code x.compareTo(y) < 0} and
     * {@code y.compareTo(z) < 0}, then {@code x.compareTo(z) < 0} must hold) and
     * invertible (the sign of the result of x.compareTo(y) must be equal to the
     * negation of the sign of the result of y.compareTo(x) for all combinations of
     * x and y).
     * <p>
     * In addition, it is recommended (but not required) that if and only if the
     * result of x.compareTo(y) is zero, then the result of x.equals(y) should be
